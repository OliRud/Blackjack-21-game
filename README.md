# ♠ Blackjack-21-game ♦
This repository contains a script to simulate a blackjack game made in python

Test your skills on this script before blowing your life savings on the real thing!

# How to play
First the deck is created and refreshed every new game (sorry to anyone who card counts)

The goal is to get to get as close to 21 as possible withought going over, you can hit to
draw a card and increase your value or you can stand and let the dealer play.

The rules for the dealer are that they must keep hitting until they go over 16.

Feel free to modify the script to your needs!
